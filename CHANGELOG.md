## [Unreleased]


## v0.1.0 - Bootstrap Foundation
2025-11-02

Initial bootstrap foundation:

- Top-level `setup.sh` orchestrator that sources modular scripts.
- `scripts/` folder with `devtools.sh`, `privacy.sh`, `aliases.sh`, and `tweaks.sh` — small, focused scripts intended to be readable and re-runnable.
- `configs/` with minimal starter configs (`.zshrc`, `.bash_aliases`, `.gitconfig`, `.vimrc`).
- Basic CI to validate shell syntax and developer-oriented docs.

This release focuses on transparency, modularity, and an easy-to-understand baseline for new Linux users.
